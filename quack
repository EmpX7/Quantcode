# Use the private_key here to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain

//This code transforms the quantum-generated key into a hex string, hashes it, and converts it to a wallet address (by focusing on Ethereum, we form a checksum address). From here, you would use the private_key to sign 
//transactions on the Ethereum network.

//This is quite basic and oversimplified - an actual implementation would need a complex wallet software, quantum-resistant authentication, error correction, etc. Also, mind the limitations of using the Ethereum blockchain 
//since it is not quantum-safe by design.

//This example also assumes that the BB84 QKD can be executed practically without interference or noise, which in reality wouldn't be true. In real-world implementations, noise and loss of qubits must be accounted for.
